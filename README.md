# Bad Apple
Play an ASCII version of Bad Apple (or any other youtube video really) in the new Windows Terminal using Python

This project is still in development (ex: there is currently no auto resizing of the window or custom size support), although I doubt it will ever be finished because it's quite useless and I figure there are already better programs out there that do this.
